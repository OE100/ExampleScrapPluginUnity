## Notice:
This repo is a fork of Evaisa's [Lethal Company Unity Template](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/LethalCompanyUnityTemplate) repo that I modified to be an easier entry point into modding Lethal Company.
Evaisa's contributions were invaluable in making this project, without both her template and LethalLib mod this wouldn't exist, as such I recommend checking her stuff out, and before starting a real project of your own cloning her template repo and reading the instructions for an easier start.

## Overview
This project is designed to be an example for how to make a scrap item in Lethal Company using and LethalLib to register it as scrap to spawn on levels.

It's made of 2 parts, the [C# BepInEx plugin project](https://github.com/OE100/ExampleScrapPlugin) and the unity project (you are here) where the assets are stored and prefabs are made.
